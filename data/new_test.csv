0,31772,What fraction of the shape is not shaded? Give your answer in its simplest form. [Image: A triangle split into 9 equal smaller triangles. 6 of them are shaded.],\( \frac{1}{3} \),0ne third is equal to tree nineth,True_Correct,NA
1,31772,What fraction of the shape is not shaded? Give your answer in its simplest form. [Image: A triangle split into 9 equal smaller triangles. 6 of them are shaded.],\( \frac{1}{3} \),1 / 3 because 6 over 9 is 2 thirds and 1 third is not shaded.,True_Correct,NA
2,31772,What fraction of the shape is not shaded? Give your answer in its simplest form. [Image: A triangle split into 9 equal smaller triangles. 6 of them are shaded.],\( \frac{1}{3} \),"1 3rd is half of 3 6th, so it is simplee to understand.",True_Neither,NA
3,31772,What fraction of the shape is not shaded? Give your answer in its simplest form. [Image: A triangle split into 9 equal smaller triangles. 6 of them are shaded.],\( \frac{1}{3} \),1 goes into everything and 3 goes into nine,True_Neither,NA
4,31772,What fraction of the shape is not shaded? Give your answer in its simplest form. [Image: A triangle split into 9 equal smaller triangles. 6 of them are shaded.],\( \frac{1}{3} \),1 out of every 3 isn't coloured,True_Correct,NA
5,31772,What fraction of the shape is not shaded? Give your answer in its simplest form. [Image: A triangle split into 9 equal smaller triangles. 6 of them are shaded.],\( \frac{1}{3} \),1 third because 6 over 9 is 2 thirds and 1 third is not shaded,True_Correct,NA
6,31772,What fraction of the shape is not shaded? Give your answer in its simplest form. [Image: A triangle split into 9 equal smaller triangles. 6 of them are shaded.],\( \frac{1}{3} \),1/3 and 3/9 are not shaded but they are equal to 1/3.,True_Correct,NA
7,31772,What fraction of the shape is not shaded? Give your answer in its simplest form. [Image: A triangle split into 9 equal smaller triangles. 6 of them are shaded.],\( \frac{1}{3} \),1/3 because 3/9 simplified divided by 3 would be 1/3,True_Correct,NA
8,31772,What fraction of the shape is not shaded? Give your answer in its simplest form. [Image: A triangle split into 9 equal smaller triangles. 6 of them are shaded.],\( \frac{1}{3} \),"1/3 because I worked out that 3/9 were not shaded and because 3 and 9 have a common factor of 3, I divided the numerator and denominator by 3 to give me 1/3",True_Correct,NA
9,31772,What fraction of the shape is not shaded? Give your answer in its simplest form. [Image: A triangle split into 9 equal smaller triangles. 6 of them are shaded.],\( \frac{1}{3} \),1/3 because it 3 shadedd in not all of them,True_Neither,NA
